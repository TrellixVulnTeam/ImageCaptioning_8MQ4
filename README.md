# Image-Captioning-PyTorch
This repo contains codes to preprocess, train and evaluate sequence models on Flickr8k Image dataset in pytorch. This repo is a fork of  "https://github.com/Subangkar/Image-Captioning-Attention-PyTorch".  
  
Pretrained Resnet50 Resnext50 Res2net50 Inception-v3 and Res2next & LSTM with attention were added. And part of the code arcitecture was modified

**Pre-requisites**:
 - Datasets:
    - Flickr8k Dataset: [images](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_Dataset.zip) and [annotations](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_text.zip)
 - Pre-trained word embeddings:
    - [Glove Embeddings of 6B words](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip)

**Data Folder Structure for training using [`train_torch.py`](train_torch.py) or [`train_attntn.py`](train_attntn.py):**
**Train model with pretrained backbone by:**
```
python train_attntn.py --name 0503 --model resnet101_attention
```
where name represents part of the name of the model and model represents type of model to be used in the training (includes: resnet50_attention res2net50_attention resnext50_attention res2next50_attention)  
After training, model parameters of each epoch will be saved in ./saved_models

**Besides, You can test model by:**
```
python test.py --name 0503 --model resnet101_attention
```
where name and model has the exactly same meaning with train_attntn.py respectively. Notice that you should specify an exist model for testing.
After testing, captions generated by the model on testset will be saved in ./captions with the name format: name_model_captions


You can modify the basic settting of training (e.g. learning rate) in config/global_config.yaml
